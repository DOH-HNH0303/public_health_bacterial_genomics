Items in the _scripts_ folder will be added in either in-line with WDL tasks or be incorporated in new Docker image. These all are currently functional, but need to be cleaned up. _cluster_by_snps.py_ will need to be modified to split into clades instead.


Report generating script will be added in the future.
